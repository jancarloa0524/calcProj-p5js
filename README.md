# calcProj-p5js
A quick project for my AP Calculus class. At the time of making this, the AP exam is done, so we are just solving a geometry/alg 1/alg 2 regents problem and creatively explaining the solution. I chose a geometry problem, and this is how to solve it.

Yeah yah, the code is very, very repetitive. I plan on fixing that as quickly as possible. This had to be coded all in one day, so.
